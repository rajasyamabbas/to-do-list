To-do list

## 👨🏼‍💻Scenario

We are developing a web application that requires user authentication. The application will have a login and signup functionality to allow users to access personalized content and features. The project will be implemented using PHP for server-side scripting and a MySQL database for storing user information.

## ⚡️Requirements:

1. User Signup:
- Users can add new tasks by entering the task title. When the "Add Task" button is clicked, the task is inserted into the "tasks" table in the database.

2. User Login:
- Registered users should be able to log in using their credentials.
- Verify the user's entered password against the stored hashed password.
- Implement session management to maintain user authentication across different pages.

3. Database:
- Stored into MySQL organized with phpmyadmin
